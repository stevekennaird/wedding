            It's up to you! It'd be great for our friends and family to take
            over the hotel, but if you choose to stay elsewhere nearby and come
            to our hotel for the wedding day, that's totally fine!

          <p>
            Maybe. We'll probably get over it though! Kidding...we know it's a
            lot to ask, and there's always the reception later in 2024 (date
            TBC) which we're looking to hold (potentially in Folkestone), so
            just come to that instead!

            recommend you do the same. But it doesn't really matter, if you find
